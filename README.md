### Interface

Interface allows you to enforce a certain structrue of a class or an object.

You can use it to describe what properties and what methods and what the types of those properties and return types of those methods are.

You might be thinking it sounds very much like a class but It's different from a class.

You don't use an interface to generate objects or create new objects based on the interface.

You just use it to enforce a certain type of structure within classes or objects.
